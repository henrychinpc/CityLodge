# CityLodge

## Advanced Programming Assignment 1

#### Assignment Overview

For this assignment you need to write a console application in the Java programming language which allows a hotel named CityLodge to manage the renting and maintenance of two types of hotel rooms: standard hotel rooms and suites.

#### General Implementation Requirements

- You are required to modularise classes properly. No method should be longer than 50 lines.
- You should aim to provide high cohesion and low coupling.
- You should aim for maximum encapsulation and information hiding.
- Your coding style should be consistent with Java coding conventions
- You should comment important sections of your code remembering that clear and readily comprehensible code is preferable to a comment.
- Your programs will be marked with Java SE 8.0. Make sure you test your programs with this setting before you make the submission.

#### Design Requirements

You must work out an object design for the above task. You should take advantage of object-oriented concepts such as composition, inheritance, method overriding, abstract classes, interfaces wherever appropriate.

Class hierarchies, relationships and components must be conceptualised in a relevant manner, based on the problem description and special conditions listed in this document. Furthermore, you must be able to explain how your program design will perform in certain scenarios and circumstances.

It may be necessary for your design to provide more functionality, such as accessors and mutators, than is specified in the above sections here for the mechanics of your design to work.
